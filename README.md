# Datastructures and algorithms course project #

The main idea of this project was to select and use structures and algorithms from C++ reference to save and use data from different affiliations, publications and references.
The course provided tests and UI for testing out the program but datastructure and algorithm part was done by the student (Datastructures.hh, Datastructures.cc).
In addition, implemented function's performance (O-notation) was estimated.
